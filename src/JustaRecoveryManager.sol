/**
 * @title JustaRecoveryManager
 *
 * @notice Recovery coordinator for JustanAccount. Registered as an owner of each opted-in account, it
 * holds the per-account registry of recoveries and orchestrates a two-step time-locked flow that, once a
 * threshold of recoveries approve and after a per-recovery delay, registers a new owner (WebAuthn passkey
 * or EOA) on the target account.
 *
 * @dev The unit of recovery is a "recovery": a `(provider, commitment)` pair plus a time-lock `delay`,
 *      keyed by `recoveryId = keccak256(abi.encode(account, provider, commitment))`. The same provider may back
 *      several recoveries for one account. The manager owns all state — recoveries & commitments, the
 *      approval threshold, the per-recovery delays, and the per-account used-salt registry — and treats
 *      providers as stateless verifiers: on each approval it calls
 *      `provider.verify(account, subject, salt, expiry, commitment, proof)`, which reverts on an invalid proof.
 *      Provider trust is therefore equivalent to provider correctness. Non-ownable, non-upgradeable,
 *      deployed once per chain at a deterministic address.
 *
 *      Recovery administration has TWO authorization doors over one shared implementation: the
 *      `onlyAccount` externals (the single-chain door — a plain call/userop from the account itself) and
 *      `executeRecoveryAdmin` (the multichain door — a batch authorized by a current owner's
 *      chain-agnostic EIP-712 signature, submittable by anyone on every chain). Both dispatch into the
 *      same internal functions, so every invariant holds identically regardless of the door used.
