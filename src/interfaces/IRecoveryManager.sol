/**
 * @title IRecoveryManager
 *
 * @notice Per-many-accounts recovery coordinator. A single JustaRecoveryManager singleton serves all
 * JustanAccount instances, so every account-scoped function takes an explicit `account`.
 *
 * The unit of recovery is a "recovery": a `(provider, commitment)` pair plus a per-recovery time-lock
 * `delay`. The same provider may back several recoveries for one account (e.g. two ECDSA EOAs, or two
 * committed emails), each with its own delay. The manager owns the recoveries, the per-account used-salt
 * registry, and the approval threshold; providers are stateless verifiers (see {IRecoveryProvider}).
 *
 * Recovery is a two-step time-locked flow built around a "recovery request":
 *   1. `requestRecovery` verifies one proof per recovery for the account's threshold of distinct
 *      recoveries, then queues a `RecoveryRequest` with `executeAt = block.timestamp + maxDelay`, where
 *      `maxDelay` is the largest delay among the approving recoveries (the request is only as fast as its
 *      most-cautious approving factor).
 *   2. After the delay elapses, anyone may call `executeRecoveryRequest` to register the new owner.
 * During the delay window the account itself may call `cancelRecoveryRequest` to abort.
